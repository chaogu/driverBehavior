# Driver Behavior machine learning evaluation

This repository contains the source-code for my masters dissertation. It contains code for data collection, pre-processing and machine learning algorithm evaluation in the driver behavior domain.

## Projects description
* The *AndroidStudioProjects* folder contains the Android app which collects sensor data;
* The *amp_R* folder contains R code for sensor data pre-processing and graphics generation;
* The *apm* folder contains Java code that performs an evaluation of several machine learning algorithms using Weka and LIBSVM;
